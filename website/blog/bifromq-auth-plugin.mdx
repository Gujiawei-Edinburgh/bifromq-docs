The **AnyAuth** plugin is a powerful extension built upon the BifroMQ `IAuthProvider` interface using PF4J. It is
designed to provide seamless authentication and authorization capabilities for BifroMQ, enabling users to secure access
to messages and resources across a wide range of clients.

<!--truncate-->

The versatility of the **AnyAuth** plugin lies in its support for various authentication mechanisms, including
traditional username/password that is for devices, auth0, and even WeChat integration. This means that users can be
authenticated by using their preferred social accounts, simplifying access to BifroMQ.

Furthermore, **AnyAuth** seamlessly integrates with BifroMQ, offering Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) through
Access Control Lists (ACL). This feature empowers administrators to define distinct roles and permissions, which can
then ensure fine-grained access control.

For more information and technical design, check the [article](https://github.com/Gujiawei-Edinburgh/bifromq-plugin-anyAuth#readme).
## Setup Steps
Integrating **AnyAuth** with BifroMQ is straightforward. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, it's important to note that **AnyAuth** focuses solely on querying users' credentials and corresponding
ACL rules. Administration tasks, such as user registration and ACL specification, are handled by other services. To
ensure that **AnyAuth** can retrieve data successfully, users need to complete device registration and specify ACL beforehand.

### Configure AnyAuth Plugin

**AnyAuth**'s flexibility hinges on the correct configuration of authentication parameters. These parameters can vary
depending on your chosen authentication method (e.g., username/password, auth0 and WeChat). The configuration file can
be found in the `bifromq-plugin-anyAuth/auth-plugin/src/main/resources` directory and will be packaged into the JAR file
after compilation. Therefore, it's crucial to configure it first.
```yaml
tenantId: ${TENANTID}
device:
  authUrl: ${AUTH_SERVICE_AUTH_URL}
  checkUrl: ${AUTH_SERVICE_CHECK_URL}
auth0:
  domain: ${AUTH0_DOMAIN}
wechat:
  appId: ${APP_ID}
  appSecret: ${APP_SECRET}
  requestUrl: https://api.weixin.qq.com/sns/jscode2session?appid=
```
### Setup BifroMQ with Plugin
Navigate to the **AnyAuth** project directory and execute the following command to generate the required output:
```mvn
cd bifromq-plugin-anyAuth && mvn clean package
```
This command will generate an `auth-plugin-${VERSION}.jar` and `auth-service-${VERSION}.tar.gz` file in their respective
target directories.

To ensure BifroMQ correctly loads the **AnyAuth** plugin, place the corresponding JAR file in the plugins directory
within BifroMQ's target directory, i.e. `bifromq-${VERSION}/plugins`. Additionally, specify the Fully Qualified Name (FQN),
e.g. `authProviderFQN: bifromq.plugin.auth.AuthProvider`, in BifroMQ's configuration file (`conf/standalone.yml`).

### Setup AnyAuth Service
The plugin JAR file acts as a client for authentication and authorization, while the **AnyAuth** service handles database
query operations. Deploy the **AnyAuth** service, specifying MySQL connection parameters for credentials and permission
rules queries.

For development or testing purposes, **AnyAuth** also supports dummy storage, i.e. set `type: Dummy` in **AnyAuth**
service configuration file.

## End-to-End Demo
Once all the setup steps are completed, you can use a WeChat MiniProgram to log in to BifroMQ and a GUI application to
simulate devices. The following video shows a typical scenario, that a device reports the current temperature via BifroMQ,
and the MiniProgram receives the message, issuing commands based on the data.
