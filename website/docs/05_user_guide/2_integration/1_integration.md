title: Integration SDK
---

[Here](https://github.com/bifromqio/bifromq-data-integration) is an integration SDK from community which could serve as a good start point for building customized data integration solutions. Integrators receive data from BifroMQ through shared subscriptions (`$share/{groupName}/topicFilter`) and
pass the data to downstream services such as Kafka or MySQL. Due to the potential volume of data in inter-service integration is large, a single
MQTT connection may experience high load and bandwidth constraints. By using shared subscriptions, the load-balancing feature is utilized, and the number of MQTT Clients can be flexibly increased or decreased as the business evolves.

Therefore, integrators need to estimate the size of the data and the corresponding bandwidth resources based on their business requirements, in order to calculate the number of MQTT Clients needed. For example, if the message rate from
BifroMQ is 10MB/s and the bandwidth per Client is 512KB/s, at least 20 Clients are needed.

The SDK encapsulates the MQTT Client. Users need to specify the number of Clients, shared group, topic, and whether it is a `cleanSession`, and implement the business logic for data received by the MQTT
Client. 

```java
IIntegrator integrator = Integrator.builder()
        .clientNum(5)
        .groupName("g1")
        .topicFilter("test/data/integration")
        .cleanSession(true)
        .userName("dev")
        .password("dev")
        .port(1883)
        .host("BifroMQ host")
        .build();
integrator.onMessageArrive()
          .doOnComplete(IProducer.DUMMY::close)
          .subscribe(IProducer.DUMMY::produce);
```

As `IIntegrator` encapsulates the MQTT Client, it needs the connection information to be specified. To ensure message transmission quality, `IIntegrator` uses `QoS = 1` by default, meaning that messages will be delivered at least once. This
may result in duplicated messages for downstream services. For MQTT related parameters, refer to the [MQTT Protocol](..%2F..%2F21_mqtt%2F1_mqtt.md). Information regarding shared subscriptions can be found in [Shared Subscription](../1_basic/3_shared_sub.md).

Integrators can implement the `IProducer` interface to execute specific business logic. An example is provided with `IProducer.DUMMY`, which prints the received messages.

## Points to Note

* Limitations of shared groups. Currently, the default maximum capacity of shared groups supported by BifroMQ is `200`. However, One can change the limit through [setting provider plugin](../../06_plugin/4_setting_provider/intro.md).
  If the integrator expects the number of clients to exceed the limit, subscriptions will fail for these clients exceeding this limit.
* Choice of topicFilter for integrators. According to the MQTT protocol, subscriptions can be non-wildcard or wildcard. Below, based on BifroMQâ€™s implementation, scenarios for both non-wildcard and wildcard subscriptions are discussed:
    * Non-wildcard subscription: The topicFilter of the integrator exactly matches the topic from the upstream sender. In BifroMQ, the corresponding routing information is cached as a single entry, resulting in a high cache hit rate for
      this scenario.
    * Wildcard subscription: If all upstream senders use the same topic, this scenario is similar to non-wildcard subscription, having a high cache hit rate. If the upstream senders use different topics, such as `test/data/{clientId}`, it
      will cause (1) BifroMQ to cache a large number of entries, possibly exceeding the cache size limit; (2) if the shared group is also large, it will result in increased latency in routing queries for a single topic, and for a large
      number of different topics, it will lead to many topics not hitting the routing cache, resulting in a decline in overall performance and Out Of Memory (OOM) issues. To address issue (1), adjusting the cache
      size (`SysProp: DIST_MAX_CACHED_SUBS_PER_TRAFFIC`) can improve cache hit rates; for issue (2), increasing cache expiration time (`expireAfterAccess`) can improve hit rates.
